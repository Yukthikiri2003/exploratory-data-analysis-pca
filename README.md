# Exploratory Data Analysis with PCA

## Problem
Understanding relationships and patterns in multi-dimensional datasets
is challenging without proper exploratory analysis.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Visualization of key patterns

## Key Insights
- Identified important feature relationships
- Reduced dimensionality while preserving variance
- Improved interpretability of complex data

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
